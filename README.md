# RedM Voice Hud v1.0

Note: If you use YACA, you have to delete the line "provide 'saltychat'" in yaca-voice/fxmanifest.lua on your server otherwise the voice system will not be discovered correctly.

A simple redm voice hud.
It's basically just an extention for "fred_hud" and therefore also using his methods, but still standalone in case you don't want to use the rest of the hud.
